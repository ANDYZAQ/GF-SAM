<img width="800" alt="image" src="figs/framework.png">
</div>
A Graph-based approach that streamlines prompt selection, addresses mask ambiguity, improves generalization of SAM-based Few-shot Semantic Segmentation.

## Advantages

- Training-Free
- External-Hyperparameter-Free
- No iterative mask generation
- Fast inference within 2s per image (NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti)
- New state-of-the-art performance
- Effective in various domains

## Todo List

- [x] Detailed discription
- [x] Gradio Demo
- [ ] Colab Demo

## Installation
